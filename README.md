# Introduction-to-CS-Java
This repository contains solutions to the selected Java programming exercises from the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach". Exercises were a part of the university coursework.

Every exercise solution has a program description, inputs and expected outputs. Also, most of the comprehensive programs contain information about the dependencies, while basic ones do not. To download any skipped dependencies, visit the <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">booksite<a>, and look for the necessary file (e.g. StdOut.java).

You can use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134076427/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=introcs-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134076427&linkId=81e8a474476da8bcb41c18cb5f609f7b">textbook<a> for additional reference.
  
Feel free to contribute to the repository with new solutions or bug fixes.
