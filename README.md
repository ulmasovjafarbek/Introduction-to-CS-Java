# Introduction-to-CS-Java
This repository contains solutions to the selected Java programming exercises from the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach". Exercises were a part of the university coursework.

Every exercise solution has a program description, inputs and expected outputs. Also, most of the comprehensive programs contain information about the dependencies, while basic ones do not. To download any skipped dependencies, visit the <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">booksite<a>, and look for the necessary file (e.g. StdOut.java).
